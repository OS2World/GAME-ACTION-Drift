     D R I F T  For OS/2 Version 1.02beta: Freeware  Readme.txt
     -------------------------------------------------------------

+++ 1. Drift Overview +++

The year is 5300 and you are in command of the brand new experimental
DriftRunner V3X22 (yep... a major improvement over the old V2X22
series). Humanity has colonized huge parts of the galaxy but the
mysterious Vhol Drift has never been successfully explored. Strange
aliens with strange technology live inside the dangerous Drift and it is
said that he who successfully explores the Drift will be both famous and
rich.

So, your mission is clear. Enter the Vhol Drift and try to penetrate as
deep as you can. But beware... the asteroid field gets more dense the
further you go and encounters with the evil Polygunzz are also more
likely. You have to shoot and destroy all the asteroids (and other
obstacles) to clear a path through the Vhol Drift to make it possible
for Terran exploration crafts to enter the Drift and exploit its
resources and discover its mysteries. The task will not be easy but if
anyone can do it, it surely is you...

Good luck!

+++ 2. Freeware? +++

Drift is Freeware. This means you can copy it as much as you like as
long as you don't change anything to the original program. I spend a lot
of time programming this game and I hope you enjoy it. If you really
like it you can always send me a postcard.

The following files should be included in Driftos2.zip (or other
compression format).

Driftos2.exe             	Main executable
Readme.txt              	Text file describing Drift (this file)


+++ 3. Drift under OS/2 +++

This is the OS/2 Warp version of Drift. This version was ported in less than 
a week from the windows version. This version is almost identical but there 
are some changes:

	* The OS/2 version is a LOT faster than the Windows version.
	* There is a new special level called 'Bigspace'.
	* Now there it is possible that you get all available powerups from
	   destroying an asteroid.
	* You can take three hits from enemy ships.

This is a beta release but in fact the code is almost identical to the Windows 
version so I suspect that there won't be may bugs left. The only problem I 
haven't solved yet is the strange slowdown when inserting a big number of 
objects into the object list (for non-programmers : when a lot of stuff appears 
at once).
I was planning on rewriting big parts of the engine but I haven't had time 
because I am working on a commercial game (I am also having a lot of problems 
finding good info regarding DIVE and MMOS/2). When I finally plan on rewriting 
Drift I will add lots of new enemies and powerups and of course network 
play. I hope I will find the time! I decided to release this version because it's no 
good having this version just sitting on my HD while it's a perfectly playable 
game.
There is no help file included in this version so here is the ultra short version:

	Shoot all enemies!
	Get powerups (small white triangles that do not shoot :)
		* Powerups are:	Fast shot	(max 3)
					Double shot	(max 1)
					Long shot	(unlimited)
					Rear shot	(max 1)
	Get shield powerup (same as your ship but white)
	Do not collide!

Easy isn't it :)
